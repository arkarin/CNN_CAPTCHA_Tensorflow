# CNN_CAPTCHA_Tensorflow
A simple CNN designed for CAPTCHA recognition

Two types of CAPTCHA to be recognized
one is generated by a captcha library [captcha 0.3](https://pypi.org/project/captcha/), later for Baidu CAPTCHA
Library is required and a font file is used to generate captcha
```
from captcha.image import ImageCaptcha
```
We share the font used in this experiment in folder fonts
