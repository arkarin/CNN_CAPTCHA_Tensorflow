# CNN_CAPTCHA_Tensorflow
A simple CNN designed for CAPTCHA recognition

Two types of CAPTCHA to be recognized  
one is generated by a captcha library [captcha 0.3](https://pypi.org/project/captcha/), use train.py  
the other is Baidu captcha (2018.4.12), use train_b.py  
we solve the CAPTCHA only for academic use, so the baidu captcha dataset is not accessible here  
Library is required and a font file is used to generate captcha  
```
from captcha.image import ImageCaptcha
```
We share the font used in this experiment in folder fonts
